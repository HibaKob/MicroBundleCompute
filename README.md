## Installation Instructions <a name="install"></a>

### Get a copy of the microbundle compute repository on your local machine

The best way to do this is to create a GitHub account and ``clone`` the repository. However, you can also download the repository by clicking the green ``Code`` button and selecting ``Download ZIP``. Downloaded and unzip the ``microbundlecompute-main`` folder and place it in a convenient location on your computer.


### Create and activate a conda virtual environment

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your local machine.
2. Open a ``Terminal`` session (or equivalent) -- note that Mac computers come with ``Terminal`` pre-installed (type ``âŒ˜-space`` and then search for ``Terminal``).
3. Type in the terminal to create a virtual environment with conda:
```bash
conda create --name microbundle-compute-env python=3.9.13
```
4. Type in the terminal to activate your virtual environment:
```bash
conda activate microbundle-compute-env
```
5. Check to make sure that the correct version of python is running (should be ``3.9.13``)
```bash
python --version
```
6. Update some base modules (just in case)
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

Note that once you have created this virtual environment you can ``activate`` and ``deactivate`` it in the future -- it is not necessary to create a new virtual environment each time you want to run this code, you can simply type ``conda activate microbundle-compute-env`` and then pick up where you left off (see also: [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)).


### Install microbundle compute

1. Use a ``Terminal`` session to navigate to the ``microbundlecompute-main`` folder. The command ``cd`` will allow you to do this (see: [terminal cheat sheet](https://terminalcheatsheet.com/))
2. Type the command ``ls`` and make sure that the file ``pyproject.toml`` is in the current directory.
3. Now, create an editable install of microbundle compute:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
4. If you would like to see what packages this has installed, you can type ``pip list``
5. You can test that the code is working with pytest (all tests should pass):
```bash
pytest -v --cov=microbundlecompute  --cov-report term-missing
```
6. To run the code from the terminal, simply start python (type ``python``) and then type ``from microbundlecompute import image_analysis as ia``. For example:
```bash
(microbundle-compute-env) eml-macbook-pro:microbundlecompute-main emma$ python
Python 3.9.13 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 27 2022, 17:01:00) 
[Clang 13.0.1 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> from microbundlecompute import image_analysis as ia
>>> ia.hello_microbundle_compute()
>>> "Hello World!
```

## Tutorial <a name="tutorial"></a>


## Validation <a name="validation"></a>


## To-Do List <a name="todo"></a>
- [ ] Adjust code so that the dictionaries for timeseries segmentation are computed automatically
- [ ] Adjust code so that the dictionaries for feature and tracking parameters can be conveniently adjusted
- [ ] Orient output (strain, displacement) direction with major axes of microbundle 
- [ ] Add functionality to compute beating frequency (might be useful to other groups)
- [ ] Ensure that division into subdomains does not result in singular matrices
- [ ] Validate displacement and strain output (synthetic data + manual tracking)
- [ ] Clean code
- [ ] Explore options for additional analysis/visualization
- [ ] Automate mask creation
